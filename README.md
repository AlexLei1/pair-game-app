<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>
On a square field of face-down cards, the player must find pairs of identical cards by revealing them in sequential order. The player starts first with one card, then with the second. If both cards are revealed, they will remain face up until the end of the game. Otherwise they will turn over. Once the player has opened all the pairs on the field, the game is considered completed.
